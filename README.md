# video-beep-detector

This was done for a friend so it will probably not work for you (unless you're that guy and in that case: **HIIIIIII!**). It will detect two distinct beeps in pair of two beeps and record the timestamp when that happened in the video. That's for when that ~~guy~~ friend presses the magic *remember this moment* button on dashcam it will store and lock that recording. He does video editing magic after that with it so this tool ~~helps~~ will help him a lot in the process, I guess.
